Project Description :Text-Based Adventure Game
The provided code snippet is a simple text-based adventure game that challenges players to navigate through a scenario involving a river and three items: Maize, Hawk, and Cock.
Players must make strategic decisions to successfully cross the river while adhering to certain rules to avoid losing the game.
The game loop is implemented using a do-while loop that allows players to play multiple rounds of the game.
Inside the loop, the player is presented with a scenario description:
They are at the bank of a river with three items: Maize, Hawk, and Cock.
They can only carry one item at a time across the river.
They can return an item to the original bank after crossing the river.
After each round, the player is given the option to try again or exit the game.
If the player chooses to try again, the loop continues; otherwise, the loop ends.
Once the loop ends (either by player choice or after winning), a message is displayed indicating that the player has exited the game.
